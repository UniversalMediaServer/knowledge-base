# How to add artwork

You can add your own artwork for folders and playlists so your frontend shows custom thumbnails instead of generic default images.

This guide explains:
- which image formats are supported
- how to name artwork files
- where to place those files
- what happens when a playlist image is missing

## Supported image formats

The following file types are supported and checked in this order. The first matching image file is used:
- `webp`
- `png`
- `jpeg`
- `jpg`
- `bmp`
- `gif`

You can use any one of these formats for both folder artwork and playlist artwork.

## Folder

To set artwork for a folder, place an image file named `folder.ext` inside that folder.

Replace `.ext` with one of the supported extensions.

Examples:
- `folder.webp`
- `folder.jpg`
- `folder.png`

## Playlists

To set artwork for a playlist, use the same base filename as the playlist file.

Example:
- Playlist file: `Jazz.m3u8`
- Artwork file: `Jazz.jpg` (or `Jazz.webp`, `Jazz.png`, and so on)

If a matching playlist artwork file is not found, the folder artwork is used as a fallback.

## Example folder structure

Use this as a reference:

```text
Music/
|-- folder.jpg
|-- Jazz/
|   |-- folder.png
|   |-- Jazz.m3u8
|   |-- Jazz.jpg
|   |-- Smooth.m3u8
|   `-- smooth-track01.mp3
`-- Rock/
    |-- folder.webp
    |-- RockHits.m3u8
    `-- track01.mp3
```

In this example:
- `Music/folder.jpg` is the artwork for the top-level `Music` folder.
- `Music/Jazz/folder.png` is the artwork for the `Jazz` folder.
- `Music/Jazz/Jazz.jpg` is used for the `Jazz.m3u8` playlist.
- `Music/Jazz/Smooth.m3u8` has no matching `Smooth.*` image, so the `Jazz` folder artwork is used.


## Web streams inside a playlist

The naming rules above work because there is a file to put the image next to. An internet radio
station or any other web address listed in a playlist has no such file, so it needs a different way
to carry its artwork: a `#EXTIMG:` line that points at the picture.

Put the line directly **above** the entry it belongs to, the same way `#EXTINF:` works. It applies to
the next entry only, so each stream gets its own line:

```text
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1,Jazz Radio
#EXTIMG:https://example.com/stations/jazz-radio.png
http://stream.example.com/jazz.mp3

#EXTINF:-1,Rock Radio
#EXTIMG:https://example.com/stations/rock-radio.jpg
http://stream.example.com/rock.mp3
```

UMS downloads the image once, stores it, and uses it for that stream from then on. It does not fetch
it again on every start.

What the line accepts:

- An **absolute** address. `https://example.com/cover.png` works, `cover.png` and `../art/cover.png`
  do not — a relative path is ignored and the stream keeps the default image.
- A `data:` URI, if you would rather keep the picture inside the playlist file than host it somewhere.
- Only `.m3u` and `.m3u8` playlists. Other playlist formats have no place to put the line.

Capitalisation of the directive itself does not matter, `#EXTIMG:` and `#extimg:` both work.

### Letting UMS write the line for you

If your control point can set the artwork of an entry, you do not have to edit the playlist by hand.
UMS writes the `#EXTIMG:` line into the playlist file itself, and only after it has successfully
loaded the picture — so a broken address leaves the file untouched instead of storing a dead link.

Because the artwork then lives in the playlist file rather than only in the database, it survives a
rebuilt database and travels with the file when you copy the playlist elsewhere.
