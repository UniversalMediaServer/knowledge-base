# 安全和隐私

## 介绍

UMS主要通过两种方式提供媒体服务——通过DLNA/UPnP供媒体播放器应用使用，以及通过HTTP(S)供网页浏览器使用。

网页浏览器通过用户账号登录，可以方便地进行安全与隐私控制。

媒体播放器应用通常不支持“用户”概念，因此，一般而言每台设备都会获取相同的内容。 这可能不是你想要的。 例如，如果你有两个文件夹 kids_safe 和 kids_unsafe，你可能想要限制儿童房中的渲染器，使其只能访问 kids_safe 文件夹。 另一种常见情况是，你和不想让其访问你媒体的人（例如室友）处于同一网络，因此你想要完全屏蔽某些渲染器。

UMS provides a number of methods to control access in those situations.

## Allow or block renderers or network devices by default
You can choose the default strategy for renderers and network devices. You can allow or deny by default, with denylists and allowlists, for complete control.

This is useful for shared living situations or wide/low-trust local networks. It is also useful for those of you using powerline adapters for your network since that can result in unwanted access from neighbors.

## Block/allow renderers and network devices

When you have chosen whether to allow or block unrecognized renderers by default, you can build your denylist or allowlist from the Home screen in the settings area.

## Link person to renderer

You can link user accounts to renderers/devices, allowing you to have independent content access and playback tracking.

For example, if you have a TV in the living room and another in your bedroom, the living room TV doesn't need to be affected by what you watch in your bedroom.

## Restrict shared content to certain groups

You can now choose to share directories or online content with certain groups. For example, if you have a person (or a device that is assigned to a person) who is a child, you can assign them to the "Kids" group, and give that group access to the "Family" directory, but not the "Horror" or "Adult Only" content. Or give them access to the Kurzgesagt web feed, but not the history podcasts.

## Hiding folders

Control the visibility of the virtual folders. These settings can be found in UMS.conf file. To hide some folders while browsing, just set their value to true or tick them in the Navigation/Share Settings tab from the advanced GUI mode.

```
hide_recently_played_folder =true
hide_new_media_folder =true
hide_video_settings =true
hide_transcode_folder =true
hide_empty_folders =true
hide_media_library_folder =true
hide_live_subtitles_folder =true
```

To hide the Web folder, you will need to untick Enable external network in General Configuration tab from the advanced GUI mode or change the `external_network =' value to false in your UMS.conf file. This will have the side effect that the automatic updater won't work. The change(s) made from the GUI will be effective after a restart.

## PIN code

All the above methods restricts access from various renderers. But if you can get access to a render that is allowed to see a folder those methods will not help you (if the kids has access to the living room tv which have access to all media then they have access to that media). The PIN code solves this issue. It allows you to hide folders/media behind a PIN code which you must enter FROM the render. By default the input is a sequence of digits (0-9) just like an ATM code. I strongly suggests that you use digit based codes as it becomes hard to type in from the renderer. But if you are extra paranoid you can add letters. It works as follows: Add a file called UMS.code to the same directory as your UMS.conf and to that file add regexp,code where regexp is a regular expression just like in "UMS.deny" file and code is the code that will grant access to the folder/media. There is no length regulation on the code. For example:
```
.*private.*,1234
```

Will force you to enter a code if the folder/media contains the word "private" and the correct code is 1234. The code then stays valid for 4 hours (if you don't change that time).

## Custom Device Configuration

Any configuration property can also be set on a per-device basis by creating a custom device configuration to override the default UMS settings (for full details see Creating a Custom Device Configuration).

For example, to customize the kids' TV:
- Click the 'Customize this device' button in the top right of the renderer's GUI popup panel and specify a name for the configuration.
- In the new conf file that opens up add any settings you wish to override for the TV, e.g. to change the server name and specify different folders:
```
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Custom Device profile
# See DefaultRenderer.conf for descriptions of all possible renderer options
# and UMS.conf for program options.

# Options in this file override the default settings for the specific Sony Bravia EX device(s) listed below.
# Specify devices by uuid (or address if no uuid), separated by commas if more than one.

device = uuid:7744ff6c-541f-48a8-0878-05fdebf240db
server_name = Kid Stuff
folders = c:\kids\stuff, c:\kids\otherstuff
```
