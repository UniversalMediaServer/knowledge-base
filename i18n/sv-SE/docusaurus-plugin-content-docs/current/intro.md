# Introduktion

This website contains the official support documentation for using Universal Media Server.

If you are not a current user, and you are looking to download it or decide whether to use it, you will probably find [our main website](https://www.universalmediaserver.com) more useful.

It is split into 3 main sections: Configuration, Guides, and Installation.

If you came here looking for specific information and didn't find it, please let us know on GitHub so we can add it.
