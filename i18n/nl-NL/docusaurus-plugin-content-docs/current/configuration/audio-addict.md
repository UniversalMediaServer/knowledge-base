# Audio Addict Network Radio

The **Audio Addict Network** is a collection of premium internet radio stations, including:

Classical Radio, Radio Tunes, Rock Radio, Jazz Radio, Zen Radio, and DI.fm.

A paid **premium account** is required to access these radio stations. You only need to register on one of the sites, as the same username and password will grant access to all of them.

UMS automatically reads all available AudioAddict radio sites, their channels, and filters. The **Favorites** channel is also supported.

## Configuration

```
# TRUE = prefer European streaming server

# Your username

```

## Location

The **Audio Addict Radio Network** folder is located within your media library. From there, you can browse and access all available stations directly.
